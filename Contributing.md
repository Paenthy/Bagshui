* [Bugs are tracked here](https://github.com/veechs/Bagshui/issues).

## Code changes

### All changes happen through pull requests
Please follow [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow). TL;DR:

1. Fork the repo and [create a new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow#create-a-branch) from `main`.
   - If you have collaborator access, you don’t need to fork, but you *do* need to create a new branch.
3. [Make changes](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow#make-changes).
4. Create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow#create-a-pull-request).


### Please try to follow existing coding style

* Indent using tabs, not spaces (I know, I know).
* Comments that explain the *why* of the code, not just the *what*.
  * Use [LuaCATS-style function comments](https://luals.github.io/wiki/annotations/#tips).
* No semicolons at end of lines.
* Avoid collapsing `if` statements into one-liners.<br><sup><small>Don’t do this: `if true then return end`.</small></sup>
* Split long lines (including conditions and function calls).<br><sup><small>Try not to go too far past column 120.</small></sup>
